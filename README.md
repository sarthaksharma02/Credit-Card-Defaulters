# Credit-Card-Defaulters
Predictive Model for finding the potential defaulters of credit cards

We have included the Jupyter Notebook file into this repository which you can use for the code reference and evaluating the code performance on prediction of the target labels after training the required model.

In this project we have used three different algorithms for training our model by considering different aspects of it and one of them is their accuracy. The three algorithms which are used in this project are:
- K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
- Linear Support Vector Classification Algorithm
- Naive Bayes Algorithm

Dataset used in this project can be found in this repository which has been uploaded to it.
